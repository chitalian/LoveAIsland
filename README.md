# Love AIsland

_Would ChatGPT swipe right on **you**?_

Love AIsland is a fully automated dating simulator designed to put your dating app profile (Tinder, Hinge, Bumble, etc.) to the test!

Let an AI agent read your profile to learn your personality and interests.
As your agent explores the island, it'll encounter other agents with real profiles, have conversations, and maybe even find true love!

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
